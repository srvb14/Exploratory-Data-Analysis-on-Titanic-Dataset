# 🚢 Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset
Performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival. Includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights using Python and Jupyter Notebook.


## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that influenced passenger survival, such as gender, age, fare, and class.

The analysis is supported by rich **data visualizations** (histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, pairplots) and a **PDF report of findings**.


## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset  
- Analyze missing values and data types  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Visualize relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Identify key factors affecting survival  
- Summarize insights and findings

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - NumPy

## 📈 Key Insights
- Around **38%** of total passengers survived.  
- **Females** and **children** had significantly higher survival chances.  
- **1st class** passengers had the best survival rates, while **3rd class** had the lowest.  
- **Fare** positively correlated with survival probability.  
- Passengers who boarded from **Cherbourg** had slightly better outcomes.  


## 📄 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_dataset.ipynb`)  
- PDF Report (`TitanicDataset_summary.pdf`)  
- Visual Charts (`Output_visualisations file- PNG format`)
- README Documentation
- Raw data (`Titanic_dataset.csv`)
